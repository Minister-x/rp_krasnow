WARNING FOR CUSTOME TEXTURES

Download everything here, and replace "mappingtextures" in the vmt files (one of the texture files for each) with whatever name you have for your own texture folder. It's super easy. After that put all of the texture files into your texture folder.

CHANGES

1. A couple invisible walls to prevent players from falling into the skybox.
2. Interiors for the main buildings outside, which consist of small apartments accessed from a teleporter. The lights can be turned on and off with switches.
3. Interiors for the processing area, same thing for the switches.
4. Added a gate to get into the processing area. There's a switch to the right of the gate.
5. Added trees above that slanted wall, and made the ground up there grass.
6. Added lampposts to the sidewalks.
7. The two posters you've sent me so far.
8. The billboard.
9. Added gates matching the fences to get to the main grassy areas outside.
